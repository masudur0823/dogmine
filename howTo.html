                        <p class="para1">
                            The first question you need to answer is: how much storage do you need? These days, it's
                            possible to have over a hundred 5 terabyte+ drives controlled by the same computer. So feel
                            free
                            to think big if you can afford it! For crypto purposes, I can tell you the Ergo blockchain
                            required to run the Ergo wallet is currently at about 15 gigabytes.
                        </p>
                        <p class="para1">
                            The second question to ask is: how fast do I need this storage to be? When you ask this
                            question, keep this in mind - your system is only as fast as your worst bottleneck across
                            all
                            components. In other words, if you had the world's fastest hard drive, it doesn’t matter if
                            the
                            system’s processor can’t keep up. When it comes to hard drive speed, a general rule of thumb
                            is
                            that a magnetic drive is slower than a solid state drive. And a solid state drive is slower
                            than
                            an m2 solid state drive.

                            Presently, blockchain and blockchain wallet software require good read/write speed in order

                            download and sync a fresh copy of the blockchain, or else you spend weeks trying to sync.
                            Once
                            the chain is synced however, magnetic drives are sufficient to download new blocks and run
                            the
                            chain.

                        The next system component to consider is memory. Memory is faster than hard drive storage, but
                        is temporary in nature. Think of it as a cache for programs loaded from the hard drive. The Ergo
                        blockchain requires at least 4gb of memory to download and sync, but benefits from 8gb. When it
                        comes to memory size, think “as much as I can fit and afford”.

                    <p class="para1">
                        As far as types, a general rule of thumb is: the higher the DDR, the faster it is. I.e. DDR3 is
                        faster than DDR2. DDR5 is faster than DD4. Again, if you select a fast m2 solid state drive hard
                        drive, your system will be degraded if you pair it with a slow DD2 set of memory sticks.

                        The amount of sticks you may purchase depends on the motherboard you select in a few steps.

                        unit. More accurately, a serial processing unit and a parallel processing unit respectively. For
                        mining, you will require both processors, but the parallel unit (the GPU) is the most important
                        piece of this whole system.

                        processors) can split the work by asking person A to start at 499 and going down and person B
                        starting at 501 and going up. With a parallel unit, we can guess all 9999 possibilities at once

                        process chunks of data instead of pieces.

                        comes to CPUs, the first question you’ll want to ask yourself is: what type of architecture do I
                        need?

                        Their cutting edgeness may mean some software isn’t supported by it just yet however. The older
                        architecture, x86, is the most popular architecture and is widely supported. In my experience, I

                        From there, you’ll just need to ask “how much power do I need?”. Remember, mining rigs benefit
                        from
                        parallel (GPU) processing, not serial processing. Other functions like video editing, graphic

                            is critical. We’ll cover cooling in greater detail in the next section.

                            The motherboard’s chipset is a general processing chip that facilitates the communication
                            between all these components. This can be a system bottleneck, so review your chip before
                            your purchase.

                    The final thing to consider is onboard components. The motherboard often comes with less performance
                    critical components such as USB drives, bluetooth, wireless, and even basic graphics capability. You
                    can accept these onboard components and purchase a motherboard with some included functionality, or
                    you can select stronger components if performance is an issue. I.e. Some people opt to purchase a
                    good networking chipset. If you choose specialized components for any of these areas, make sure your
                    motherboard supports it as well.

                    sure you have enough screw slots to properly place your components. Additionally, certain components
                    we selected earlier may not have come with screws. M2 hard drives are notorious for this.

                    The two final factors to consider here are cooling, and “cool” ;). As I’ve drilled, your case needs
                    to have sufficient airflow to cool the components it houses. It’s also responsible for housing the
                    cool LED lights you may see on some machines! I invite you to research commercial cases that are
                    specifically made for cooling.
